Major rewrite of EtchDroid!

• New Material You UI, much more intuitive and easier to use!
• EtchDroid will now recover from most write failures and ask you to unplug and reconnect your USB drive
• After writing the image, it will also be verified to ensure it didn't get corrupted
• The DMG functionality has been removed; use an older version if you still need it
